# ChatGPT Share 68f578d6-8f18-800a-9779-c2d1d32e7709

We attempted to retrieve the shared conversation referenced at
`https://chatgpt.com/share/68f578d6-8f18-800a-9779-c2d1d32e7709` so we could verify that
all relevant information is reflected in this repository. However, outbound requests to
chatgpt.com are blocked from the build environment and the request fails with HTTP 403
(Forbidden).

Because of this restriction the conversation content could not be reviewed. If access to the
conversation is required in the future, please download the transcript locally and add it to the
repository (for example under `docs/`) or provide the relevant requirements directly within an
issue. Once the transcript is available locally we can cross-check the implementation against
those requirements and update the project as needed.
